Python 2.5 or higher is required to use LabJackPython. To use the UE9
over Ethernet, install comm firmware 1.50 or higher. At the moment itâ€™s
on the beta page:

    http://labjack.com/support/firmware/ue9/beta

Installation is easy:
    $ sudo python setup.py install

(Leave off the `sudo' on Windows.)
    
From there, interacting with your devices is easy.

For U3:
>>> import u3
>>> d = u3.U3()
>>> d.configU3()
{'BootloaderVersion': '0.27',
 'CIODirection': 0,
 ...,
}
>>> d.close()

For U6:
>>> import u6
>>> d = u6.U6()
>>> d.configU6()
{'BootloaderVersion': '6.15',
 'FirmwareVersion': '0.88',
 ..., 
}
>>> d.close()

For UE9:
>>> import ue9
>>> d = ue9.UE9()
>>> d.commConfig()
{'IPAddress' : '192.168.1.209'
 ...,
}
>>> d.close()

For U12:
>>> import u12
>>> d = u12.U12()
>>> d.eAnalogIn(0)
{'overVoltage': 0,
 'idnum': 0,
 'voltage': 1.42578125
}
>>> d.close()

From there, check the Examples/ directory, especially the workingWithModbus.py file to get started.
