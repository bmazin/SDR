;
; DESCRIPTION:
;
;  DDEABM performs integration of a system of one or more ordinary
;  differential equations using a Predictor-Corrector technique.  An
;  adaptive Adams-Bashford-Moulton method of variable order between
;  one and twelve, adaptive stepsize, and error control, is used to
;  integrate equations of the form:
;
;     DF_DT = FUNCT(T, F)
;
;  T is the independent variable, F is the (possibly vector) function
;  value at T, and DF_DT is the derivative of F with respect to T,
;  evaluated at T.  FUNCT is a user function which returns the
;  derivative of one or more equations.  
;
;  DDEABM is based on the public domain procedure DDEABM.F written by
;  L. F. Shampine and M. K. Gordon, and available in the DEPAC package
;  of solvers within SLATEC library.
;
;  DDEABM is used primarily to solve non-stiff and mildly stiff
;  ordinary differential equations, where evaluation of the user
;  function is expensive, or high precision is demanded (close to the
;  machine precision).  A Runge-Kutta technique may be more
;  appropriate if lower precision is acceptable.  For stiff problems
;  neither Adams-Bashford-Moulton nor Runge-Kutta techniques are
;  appropriate.  DDEABM has code which detects the stiffness of the
;  problem and reports it.
;
;  The user can operate DDEABM in three different modes:
;
;    * the user requests one output at a specific point (the default),
;      and maintains the integrator state using the STATE keyword;
;
;    * the user requests a grid of points (by passing an array to
;      TOUT), and optionally maintains the integrator state for
;      subsequent integrations using the STATE keyword;
;
;    * the user requests output at the natural adaptive stepsizes
;      using the /INTERMEDIATE keyword.
;
;  When the user requests explicit output points using TOUT, it is
;  likely that the output will be interpolated between two natural
;  stepsize points.
;
;  If the user requests a grid of outputs, and the integration fails
;  before reaching the requested endpoint, then control returns
;  immediately to the user with the appropriate STATUS code.
;
;  The initial conditions are given by F0, when T = T0.  The number of
;  equations is determined by the number of elements in F0.
;  Integration stops when the independent variable T reaches the final
;  value of TOUT.  If the user wants to continue the integration, it
;  can be restarted with a new call to DDEABM, and a new value of
;  TOUT.
;
; USER FUNCTION
;
;  The user function FUNCT must be of the following form:
;
;  FUNCTION FUNCT, T, F, PRIVATE, ...  [ CONTROL=CONTROL ] ...
;     ; ... compute derivatives ...
;     RETURN, DF_DT
;  END
;
;  The function must accept at least two, but optionally three,
;  parameters.  The first, 'T', is the scalar independent variable
;  where the derivatives are to be evaluated.  The second, 'F', is the
;  vector of function values.  The function must return an array of
;  same size as 'F'.  The third positional parameter, 'PRIVATE', is a
;  purely optional PRIVATE parameter.  FUNCT may accept more
;  positional parameters, but DDEABM will not use them.  Any number of
;  keyword parameters can be passed using the FUNCTARGS keyword.
;
;  The user function FUNCT must not modify either the independent
;  variable 'T' or the function values 'F'.
;
; PASSING 'CONTROL' MESSAGES TO THE USER FUNCTION
;
;  DDEABM may pass control information to the user function, other
;  than requests for function evaluation.  DDEABM will only do this if
;  the /CONTROL keyword is set when DDEABM was invoked.
;
;  When control information has been enabled, the user function *must*
;  accept a keyword named CONTROL.  A message may be passed in this
;  keyword.  If the user function is invoked with the CONTROL keyword
;  defined, the user function should not evaluate the function, but
;  rather it must respond to the message and return the appropriate
;  value.
;
;  The CONTROL message will be a structure of the form,
;     { MESSAGE: 'name', ... }
;  where the MESSAGE field indicates a control message.  Additional
;  fields may carry more information, depending on the message.
;
;  The following control messages are implemented:
;    * { MESSAGE: 'INITIALIZE' } - the integrator has been initialized
;      and the user function may also initialize any state variables,
;      load large data tables, etc.
;      RETURN: 0 for success, negative number to indicate failure.
;
;  If the user function does not recognize a message, a value of 0
;  should be returned.
;
;
; RESTARTING THE INTEGRATOR
;
;  When restarting the integrator, the STATE keyword can be used to
;  save some computation time.  Upon return from DDEABM the STATE
;  keyword will contain a structure which describes the state of the
;  integrator at the output point.  The user need merely pass this
;  variable back into the next call to continue integration.  The
;  value of T, and the function value F, must not be adjusted between
;  calls to DDEABM.
;
;  If T or F0 are to be adjusted, then the integrator must be
;  restarted afresh *without* the previous state.  This can be
;  achieved either by reseting STATE to undefined, or by setting the
;  /INIT keyword to DDEABM.
;
; ERROR CONTROL
;
;  Local error control is governed by two keywords, EPSABS and EPSREL.
;  The former governs the absolute error, while the latter governs the
;  relative or fractional error.  The error test at each iteration is:
;
;     ABS(ERROR)   LE   EPSREL*ABS(F) + EPSABS
;  
;  A scalar value indicates the same constraint should be applied to
;  every equation; a vector array indicates constraints should be
;  applied individually to each component.
;
;  Setting EPSABS=0.D0 results in a pure relative error test on that
;  component. Setting EPSREL=0. results in a pure absolute error test
;  on that component.  A mixed test with non-zero EPSREL and EPSABS
;  corresponds roughly to a relative error test when the solution
;  component is much bigger than EPSABS and to an absolute error test
;  when the solution component is smaller than the threshold EPSABS.
;  
;  Proper selection of the absolute error control parameters EPSABS
;  requires you to have some idea of the scale of the solution
;  components.  To acquire this information may mean that you will
;  have to solve the problem more than once. In the absence of scale
;  information, you should ask for some relative accuracy in all the
;  components (by setting EPSREL values non-zero) and perhaps impose
;  extremely small absolute error tolerances to protect against the
;  danger of a solution component becoming zero.
;  
;  The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an accuracy
;  unreasonable for the machine being used.  It will advise you if you
;  ask for too much accuracy and inform you as to the maximum accuracy
;  it believes possible.
;
; HARD LIMIT ON T
;
;  If for some reason there is a hard limit on the independent
;  variable T, then the user should specify TSTOP.  For efficiency
;  DDEABM may try to integrate *beyond* the requested point of
;  termination, TOUT, and then interpolate backwards to obtain the
;  function value at the requested point.  If this is not possible
;  because the function because the equation changes, or if there is a
;  discontinuity, then users should specify a value for TSTOP; the
;  integrator will not go past this point.
;
; DISCONTINUITIES
;
;  If the ODE or solution has discontinuities at known points, these
;  should be passed to DDEABM in order to aid the solution.  The
;  TIMPULSE and YIMPULSE keyword variables allow the user to identify
;  the positions of the discontinuities and their amplitudes.  As T
;  crosses TIMPULSE(i) the solution will change from Y to
;  Y+YIMPULSE(*,i) in a stepwise fashion.  
;
;  Discontinuities in the function to be integrated can also be
;  entered in this way.  Although DDEABM can adapt the integration
;  step size to accomodate changes in the user function, it may be
;  better to identify such discontinuities.  In that case TIMPULSE(i)
;  should still identify the position of discontinuity, and
;  YIMPULSE(*,i) should be 0.
;
;  Currently this functionality is implemented with restarts of the
;  integrator at the crossing points of the discontinuities.
;
;  This technique handles only discontinuities at explicitly known
;  values of T.  If the discontinuity condition is defined in terms of
;  Y  (or Y and T), then the condition is implicit.  DDEABM does not
;  handle that type of condition.
;
;  You may list the TIMPULSE points in the TOUT output grid.  If an
;  impulse point appears once in TOUT, the corresponding function
;  values reported in YGRID and YPGRID will be from *before* crossing
;  the discontinuity.  If the same TIMPULSE point appears *twice* in
;  TOUT, then the first and second values will correspond to before
;  and after crossing the discontinuity, respectively.
;
;
; INPUTS:
;
;  FUNCT - by default, a scalar string containing the name of an IDL
;          function to be integrated.  See above for the formal
;          definition of FUNCT.  (No default).
;
;  T0 - scalar number, upon input the starting value of the
;       independent variable T.  Upon output, the final value of T.
;
;  Y - vector.  Upon input the starting values of the function for T =
;      T0.  Upon output, the final (vector) value of the function.
;
;  TOUT - must be at least a scalar, but optionally a vector,
;         specifies the desired points of output.
;
;         If TOUT is a scalar and INTERMEDIATE is not set, then DDEABM
;         integrates up to TOUT.  A scalar value of the function at
;         TOUT is returned in F.
;
;         If TOUT is a scalar and /INTERMEDIATE is set, then DDEABM
;         computes a grid of function values at the optimal step
;         points of the solution.  The grid of values is returned in
;         TGRID, YGRID, and YPGRID.  The final function value,
;         evaluated at the last point in TOUT, is returned in F.
;
;         If TOUT is a vector, then DDEABM computes a grid of function
;         values at the requested points.  The grid of values is
;         returned in TGRID, YGRID and YPGRID.  The final function
;         value, evaluated at the last point in TOUT, is returned in
;         F.  If integrating forwards (TOUT greater than T0), TOUT
;         must be strictly increasing.  Generally speaking, TOUT
;         output points should not repeat, except for discontinuities
;         as noted above.
;
;         It is possible for TOUT to be less than T0, i.e., to
;         integrate backwards, in which case TOUT must be strictly
;         decreasing instead.
; 
;  PRIVATE - any optional variable to be passed on to the function to
;            be integrated.  For functions, PRIVATE is passed as the
;            second positional parameter.  DDEABM does not examine or
;            alter PRIVATE.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;
;   CONTROL - if set, then control messages will be set to the user
;             function as described above.  If not set, then no
;             control messages will be passed.
;
;   EPSABS - a scalar number, the absolute error tolerance requested
;            in the integral computation.  If less than or equal to
;            zero, then the value is ignored.
;            Default: 0
;
;   EPSREL - a scalar number, the relative (i.e., fractional) error
;            tolerance in the integral computation.  If less than or
;            equal to zero, then the value is ignored.
;            Default: 1e-4 for float, 1d-6 for double
;
;   ERRMSG - upon return, a descriptive error message.
;
;   FUNCTARGS - A structure which contains the parameters to be passed
;               to the user-supplied function specified by FUNCT via
;               the _EXTRA mechanism.  This is the way you can pass
;               additional data to your user-supplied function without
;               using common blocks.  By default, no extra parameters
;               are passed to the user-supplied function.
;
;   INIT - if set, indicates that the integrator is to be restarted
;          afresh.
;
;   INTERMEDIATE - if set, indicates that the integrator is to compute
;                  at the natural step points.
;
;   MAX_STEPSIZE - a positive scalar value, the maximum integration
;                  step size to take per iteration.  The lesser of the
;                  "natural" step size and MAX_STEPSIZE is used.  If
;                  MAX_STEPSIZE is not specified, there is no maximum.
;
;   NFEV - upon output, the scalar number of function evaluations.
;
;   NGRID - if /INTERMEDIATE is set, the number of points to compute
;           before returning.
;           Default: 1
;
;   NOUTGRID - upon output, the number of grid points computed.  This
;              may be smaller than the requested number of grid points
;              (either via NGRID or TOUT) if an error occurs.
;
;   STATE - upon input and return, the integrator state.  Users should
;           not modify this structure.  If the integrator is to be
;           restarted afresh, then the /INIT keyword should be set, in
;           order to clear out the old state information.
;
;   STATUS - upon output, the integer status of the integration.
;
;           1 - A step was successfully taken in the
;               intermediate-output mode.  The code has not yet
;               reached TOUT.
; 
;           2 - The integration to TOUT was successfully completed
;               (T=TOUT) by stepping exactly to TOUT.
; 
;           3 - The integration to TOUT was successfully completed
;               (T=TOUT) by stepping past TOUT.  Y(*) is obtained by
;               interpolation.
; 
;                       *** Task Interrupted ***
;                 Reported by negative values of STATUS
; 
;           -1 - A large amount of work has been expended.  (500 steps
;                attempted)
; 
;           -2 - The error tolerances are too stringent.
; 
;           -3 - The local error test cannot be satisfied because you
;                specified a zero component in EPSABS and the
;                corresponding computed solution component is zero.
;                Thus, a pure relative error test is impossible for
;                this component.
; 
;           -4 - The problem appears to be stiff.
; 
;                       *** Task Terminated ***
;                 Reported by the value of STATUS=-33
; 
;           -33 - The code has encountered trouble from which it
;                 cannot recover.  A error message is printed
;                 explaining the trouble and control is returned to
;                 the calling program. For example, this occurs when
;                 invalid input is detected.
;
;           -16 - The user function returned a non-finite 
;
;   TGRID - upon output, the grid of values of T for which the
;           integration is provided.
;
;   TIMPULSE - array of values of T where discontinuities occur.  The
;              array should be in ascending order.  TIMPULSE must
;              match YIMPULSE.
;
;   TSTOP - a scalar, specifies a hard limit for T, beyond which the
;           integration must not proceed.
;           Default:  none, i.e., integration is allowed to
;                    "overshoot"
;
;   YGRID - upon output, the grid of function values for which the
;           integration is provided.
;
;   YIMPULSE - array of discontinuity offset values, of the form
;              DBLARR(NEQ,NIMPULSE), where NEQ is the size of Y and
;              NIMPULSE is the size of TIMPULSE.  YIMPULSE(*,I) is the
;              amount to *add* to Y when T crosses TIMPULSE(I) going
;              in the positive direction.
;
;   YPGRID - upon ouptut, the grid of function derivative values at
;            the points where the integration is provided.

; C * ABSTRACT *
; C ************
; C
; C   Subroutine DDEABM uses the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton
; C   Predictor-Corrector formulas of orders one through twelve to
; C   integrate a system of NEQ first order ordinary differential
; C   equations of the form
; C                         DU/DX = DF(X,U)
; C   when the vector Y(*) of initial values for U(*) at X=T is given.
; C   The subroutine integrates from T to TOUT. It is easy to continue the
; C   integration to get results at additional TOUT.  This is the interval
; C   mode of operation.  It is also easy for the routine to return with
; C   the solution at each intermediate step on the way to TOUT.  This is
; C   the intermediate-output mode of operation.
; C
; C   DDEABM uses subprograms DDEABM_DDES, DDEABM_DSTEPS, DDEABM_DINTP, DHSTRT, DHVNRM,
; C   D1MACH, and the error handling routine XERMSG.  The only machine
; C   dependent parameters to be assigned appear in D1MACH.

; C **********************************************************************
; C * Description of The Arguments To DDEABM (An Overview) *
; C **********************************************************************
; C
; C   The Parameters are
; C
; C      DF -- This is the name of a subroutine which you provide to
; C             define the differential equations.
; C
; C      NEQ -- This is the number of (first order) differential
; C             equations to be integrated.
; C
; C      T -- This is a DOUBLE PRECISION value of the independent
; C           variable.
; C
; C      Y(*) -- This DOUBLE PRECISION array contains the solution
; C              components at T.
; C
; C      TOUT -- This is a DOUBLE PRECISION point at which a solution is
; C              desired.
; C
; C      INFO(*) -- The basic task of the code is to integrate the
; C             differential equations from T to TOUT and return an
; C             answer at TOUT.  INFO(*) is an INTEGER array which is used
; C             to communicate exactly how you want this task to be
; C             carried out.
; C

; C * INPUT -- What To Do On The First Call To DDEABM *
; C **********************************************************************
; C
; C   The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new
; C   problem.  Read through the descriptions of all the following items,
; C   provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set
; C   appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and
; C   give information about how you want the problem to be solved.
; C
; C
; C      DF -- Provide a subroutine of the form
; C                               DF(X,U,UPRIME,PAR,IPAR)
; C             to define the system of first order differential equations
; C             which is to be solved.  For the given values of X and the
; C             vector  U(*)=(U(1),U(2),...,U(NEQ)) , the subroutine must
; C             evaluate the NEQ components of the system of differential
; C             equations  DU/DX=DF(X,U)  and store the derivatives in the
; C             array UPRIME(*), that is,  UPRIME(I) = * DU(I)/DX *  for
; C             equations I=1,...,NEQ.
; C
; C             Subroutine DF must NOT alter X or U(*).  You must declare
; C             the name df in an external statement in your program that
; C             calls DDEABM.  You must dimension U and UPRIME in DF.
; C
; C             RPAR and IPAR are DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER parameter
; C             arrays which you can use for communication between your
; C             calling program and subroutine DF. They are not used or
; C             altered by DDEABM.  If you do not need RPAR or IPAR,
; C             ignore these parameters by treating them as dummy
; C             arguments. If you do choose to use them, dimension them in
; C             your calling program and in DF as arrays of appropriate
; C             length.
; C
; C      NEQ -- Set it to the number of differential equations.
; C             (NEQ .GE. 1)
; C
; C      T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration.
; C             You must use a program variable for T because the code
; C             changes its value.
; C
; C      Y(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of the NEQ solution
; C             components at the initial point.  You must dimension Y at
; C             least NEQ in your calling program.
; C
; C      TOUT -- Set it to the first point at which a solution
; C             is desired.  You can take TOUT = T, in which case the code
; C             will evaluate the derivative of the solution at T and
; C             return. Integration either forward in T  (TOUT .GT. T)  or
; C             backward in T  (TOUT .LT. T)  is permitted.
; C
; C             The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using
; C             step sizes which are automatically selected so as to
; C             achieve the desired accuracy.  If you wish, the code will
; C             return with the solution and its derivative following
; C             each intermediate step (intermediate-output mode) so that
; C             you can monitor them, but you still must provide TOUT in
; C             accord with the basic aim of the code.
; C
; C             The first step taken by the code is a critical one
; C             because it must reflect how fast the solution changes near
; C             the initial point.  The code automatically selects an
; C             initial step size which is practically always suitable for
; C             the problem. By using the fact that the code will not step
; C             past TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary,
; C             restrict the length of the initial step size.
; C
; C             For some problems it may not be permissible to integrate
; C             past a point TSTOP because a discontinuity occurs there
; C             or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond
; C             TSTOP.  When you have declared a TSTOP point (see INFO(4)
; C             and RWORK(1)), you have told the code not to integrate
; C             past TSTOP.  In this case any TOUT beyond TSTOP is invalid
; C             input.
; C
; C      INFO(*) -- Use the INFO array to give the code more details about
; C             how you want your problem solved.  This array should be
; C             dimensioned of length 15 to accommodate other members of
; C             DEPAC or possible future extensions, though DDEABM uses
; C             only the first four entries.  You must respond to all of
; C             the following items which are arranged as questions.  The
; C             simplest use of the code corresponds to answering all
; C             questions as YES ,i.e. setting ALL entries of INFO to 0.
; C
; C        INFO(1) -- This parameter enables the code to initialize
; C               itself.  You must set it to indicate the start of every
; C               new problem.
; C
; C            **** Is this the first call for this problem ...
; C                  YES -- set INFO(1) = 0
; C                   NO -- not applicable here.
; C                         See below for continuation calls.  ****
; C
; C        INFO(2) -- How much accuracy you want of your solution
; C               is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL.
; C               The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars.
; C               To obtain more flexibility, they can both be vectors.
; C               The code must be told your choice.
; C
; C            **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ...
; C                  YES -- set INFO(2) = 0
; C                         and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL
; C                   NO -- set INFO(2) = 1
; C                         and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL ****
; C
; C        INFO(3) -- The code integrates from T in the direction
; C               of TOUT by steps.  If you wish, it will return the
; C               computed solution and derivative at the next
; C               intermediate step (the intermediate-output mode) or
; C               TOUT, whichever comes first.  This is a good way to
; C               proceed if you want to see the behavior of the solution.
; C               If you must have solutions at a great many specific
; C               TOUT points, this code will compute them efficiently.
; C
; C            **** Do you want the solution only at
; C                 TOUT (and not at the next intermediate step) ...
; C                  YES -- set INFO(3) = 0
; C                   NO -- set INFO(3) = 1 ****
; C
; C        INFO(4) -- To handle solutions at a great many specific
; C               values TOUT efficiently, this code may integrate past
; C               TOUT and interpolate to obtain the result at TOUT.
; C               Sometimes it is not possible to integrate beyond some
; C               point TSTOP because the equation changes there or it is
; C               not defined past TSTOP.  Then you must tell the code
; C               not to go past.
; C
; C            **** Can the integration be carried out without any
; C                 Restrictions on the independent variable T ...
; C                  YES -- set INFO(4)=0
; C                   NO -- set INFO(4)=1
; C                         and define the stopping point TSTOP by
; C                         setting RWORK(1)=TSTOP ****
; C
; C      RTOL, ATOL -- You must assign relative (RTOL) and absolute (ATOL)
; C             error tolerances to tell the code how accurately you want
; C             the solution to be computed.  They must be defined as
; C             program variables because the code may change them.  You
; C             have two choices --
; C                  Both RTOL and ATOL are scalars. (INFO(2)=0)
; C                  Both RTOL and ATOL are vectors. (INFO(2)=1)
; C             In either case all components must be non-negative.
; C
; C             The tolerances are used by the code in a local error test
; C             at each step which requires roughly that
; C                     ABS(LOCAL ERROR) .LE. RTOL*ABS(Y)+ATOL
; C             for each vector component.
; C             (More specifically, a Euclidean norm is used to measure
; C             the size of vectors, and the error test uses the magnitude
; C             of the solution at the beginning of the step.)
; C
; C             The true (global) error is the difference between the true
; C             solution of the initial value problem and the computed
; C             approximation.  Practically all present day codes,
; C             including this one, control the local error at each step
; C             and do not even attempt to control the global error
; C             directly.  Roughly speaking, they produce a solution Y(T)
; C             which satisfies the differential equations with a
; C             residual R(T),    DY(T)/DT = DF(T,Y(T)) + R(T)   ,
; C             and, almost always, R(T) is bounded by the error
; C             tolerances.  Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of
; C             the computed Y is comparable to the error tolerances. This
; C             code will usually, but not always, deliver a more accurate
; C             solution if you reduce the tolerances and integrate again.
; C             By comparing two such solutions you can get a fairly
; C             reliable idea of the true error in the solution at the
; C             bigger tolerances.
; C
; C             Setting ATOL=0.D0 results in a pure relative error test on
; C             that component. Setting RTOL=0. results in a pure absolute
; C             error test on that component.  A mixed test with non-zero
; C             RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a relative error
; C             test when the solution component is much bigger than ATOL
; C             and to an absolute error test when the solution component
; C             is smaller than the threshold ATOL.
; C
; C             Proper selection of the absolute error control parameters
; C             ATOL  requires you to have some idea of the scale of the
; C             solution components.  To acquire this information may mean
; C             that you will have to solve the problem more than once. In
; C             the absence of scale information, you should ask for some
; C             relative accuracy in all the components (by setting  RTOL
; C             values non-zero) and perhaps impose extremely small
; C             absolute error tolerances to protect against the danger of
; C             a solution component becoming zero.
; C
; C             The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an
; C             accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used.  It will
; C             advise you if you ask for too much accuracy and inform
; C             you as to the maximum accuracy it believes possible.

; C      RWORK(*) -- Dimension this DOUBLE PRECISION work array of length

; C        from T to TOUT (the interval mode), usually all you will need
; C        to do is specify a new TOUT upon reaching the current TOUT.
; C
; C        Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below,
; C        in particular do not alter NEQ, T, Y(*), RWORK(*), IWORK(*) or
; C        the differential equation in subroutine DF. Any such alteration
; C        constitutes a new problem and must be treated as such, i.e.
; C        you must start afresh.
; C
; C        You cannot change from vector to scalar error control or vice
; C        versa (INFO(2)) but you can change the size of the entries of
; C        RTOL, ATOL.  Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier
; C        to integrate.  Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation
; C        harder to integrate and should generally be avoided.
; C
; C        You can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the
; C        interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time.
; C
; C        If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going
; C        past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the
; C        code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently
; C        specified TSTOP.  Once TSTOP has been reached you must change
; C        the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4)=0.  You may change INFO(4)
; C        or TSTOP at any time but you must supply the value of TSTOP in
; C        RWORK(1) whenever you set INFO(4)=1.
; C
; C        The parameter INFO(1) is used by the code to indicate the
; C        beginning of a new problem and to indicate whether integration
; C        is to be continued.  You must input the value  INFO(1) = 0
; C        when starting a new problem.  You must input the value
; C        INFO(1) = 1  if you wish to continue after an interrupted task.
; C        Do not set  INFO(1) = 0  on a continuation call unless you
; C        want the code to restart at the current T.
; C
; C                         *** Following A Completed Task ***
; C         If
; C             IDID = 1, call the code again to continue the integration
; C                     another step in the direction of TOUT.
; C
; C             IDID = 2 or 3, define a new TOUT and call the code again.
; C                     TOUT must be different from T. You cannot change
; C                     the direction of integration without restarting.
; C
; C                         *** Following An Interrupted Task ***
; C                     To show the code that you realize the task was
; C                     interrupted and that you want to continue, you
; C                     must take appropriate action and reset INFO(1) = 1
; C         If
; C             IDID = -1, the code has attempted 500 steps.
; C                     If you want to continue, set INFO(1) = 1 and
; C                     call the code again. An additional 500 steps
; C                     will be allowed.
; C
; C             IDID = -2, the error tolerances RTOL, ATOL have been
; C                     increased to values the code estimates appropriate
; C                     for continuing.  You may want to change them
; C                     yourself.  If you are sure you want to continue
; C                     with relaxed error tolerances, set INFO(1)=1 and
; C                     call the code again.
; C
; C             IDID = -3, a solution component is zero and you set the
; C                     corresponding component of ATOL to zero.  If you
; C                     are sure you want to continue, you must first
; C                     alter the error criterion to use positive values
; C                     for those components of ATOL corresponding to zero
; C                     solution components, then set INFO(1)=1 and call
; C                     the code again.
; C
; C             IDID = -4, the problem appears to be stiff.  It is very
; C                     inefficient to solve such problems with DDEABM.
; C                     The code DDEBDF in DEPAC handles this task
; C                     efficiently.  If you are absolutely sure you want
; C                     to continue with DDEABM, set INFO(1)=1 and call
; C                     the code again.
; C
; C             IDID = -5,-6,-7,..,-32  --- cannot occur with this code
; C                     but used by other members of DEPAC or possible

; C
; C                         *** Following A Terminated Task ***
; C         If
; C             IDID = -33, you cannot continue the solution of this
; C                     problem.  An attempt to do so will result in your

; C
; C ....   You have a choice of three differential equation solvers from
; C ....   DEPAC. The following brief descriptions are meant to aid you in
; C ....   choosing the most appropriate code for your problem.
; C
; C ....   DDERKF is a fifth order Runge-Kutta code. It is the simplest of
; C ....   the three choices, both algorithmically and in the use of the
; C ....   code. DDERKF is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and
; C ....   mildly stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations
; C ....   are not expensive. It should generally not be used to get high
; C ....   accuracy results nor answers at a great many specific points.
; C ....   Because DDERKF has very low overhead costs, it will usually
; C ....   result in the least expensive integration when solving
; C ....   problems requiring a modest amount of accuracy and having
; C ....   equations that are not costly to evaluate. DDERKF attempts to
; C ....   discover when it is not suitable for the task posed.
; C
; C ....   DDEABM is a variable order (one through twelve) Adams code.
; C ....   Its complexity lies somewhere between that of DDERKF and
; C ....   DDEBDF.  DDEABM is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and
; C ....   mildly stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations
; C ....   are expensive, high accuracy results are needed or answers at
; C ....   many specific points are required. DDEABM attempts to discover
; C ....   when it is not suitable for the task posed.
; C
; C ....   DDEBDF is a variable order (one through five) backward
; C ....   differentiation formula code. it is the most complicated of
; C ....   the three choices. DDEBDF is primarily designed to solve stiff
; C ....   differential equations at crude to moderate tolerances.
; C ....   If the problem is very stiff at all, DDERKF and DDEABM will be
; C ....   quite inefficient compared to DDEBDF. However, DDEBDF will be
; C ....   inefficient compared to DDERKF and DDEABM on non-stiff problems
; C ....   because it uses much more storage, has a much larger overhead,
; C ....   and the low order formulas will not give high accuracies
; C ....   efficiently.
; C
; C ....   The concept of stiffness cannot be described in a few words.
; C ....   If you do not know the problem to be stiff, try either DDERKF
; C ....   or DDEABM. Both of these codes will inform you of stiffness
; C ....   when the cost of solving such problems becomes important.

; C
; C   DDEABM_DHSTRT computes a starting step size to be used in solving initial
; C   value problems in ordinary differential equations.
; C
; C **********************************************************************
; C  ABSTRACT
; C
; C     Subroutine DDEABM_DHSTRT computes a starting step size to be used by an
; C     initial value method in solving ordinary differential equations.
; C     It is based on an estimate of the local Lipschitz constant for the
; C     differential equation   (lower bound on a norm of the Jacobian) ,
; C     a bound on the differential equation  (first derivative) , and
; C     a bound on the partial derivative of the equation with respect to
; C     the independent variable.
; C     (all approximated near the initial point A)
; C
; C     Subroutine DDEABM_DHSTRT uses a function subprogram DHVNRM for computing
; C     a vector norm. The maximum norm is presently utilized though it
; C     can easily be replaced by any other vector norm. It is presumed
; C     that any replacement norm routine would be carefully coded to
; C     prevent unnecessary underflows or overflows from occurring, and
; C     also, would not alter the vector or number of components.
; C
; C **********************************************************************
; C  On input you must provide the following
; C
; C      DF -- This is a subroutine of the form
; C                               DF(X,U,UPRIME,RPAR,IPAR)
; C             which defines the system of first order differential
; C             equations to be solved. For the given values of X and the
; C             vector  U(*)=(U(1),U(2),...,U(NEQ)) , the subroutine must
; C             evaluate the NEQ components of the system of differential
; C             equations  DU/DX=DF(X,U)  and store the derivatives in the
; C             array UPRIME(*), that is,  UPRIME(I) = * DU(I)/DX *  for
; C             equations I=1,...,NEQ.
; C
; C             Subroutine DF must not alter X or U(*). You must declare
; C             the name DF in an external statement in your program that
; C             calls DDEABM_DHSTRT. You must dimension U and UPRIME in DF.
; C
; C             RPAR and IPAR are DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER parameter
; C             arrays which you can use for communication between your
; C             program and subroutine DF. They are not used or altered by
; C             DDEABM_DHSTRT. If you do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these
; C             parameters by treating them as dummy arguments. If you do
; C             choose to use them, dimension them in your program and in
; C             DF as arrays of appropriate length.
; C
; C      NEQ -- This is the number of (first order) differential equations
; C             to be integrated.
; C
; C      A -- This is the initial point of integration.
; C
; C      B -- This is a value of the independent variable used to define
; C             the direction of integration. A reasonable choice is to
; C             set  B  to the first point at which a solution is desired.
; C             You can also use  B, if necessary, to restrict the length
; C             of the first integration step because the algorithm will
; C             not compute a starting step length which is bigger than
; C             ABS(B-A), unless  B  has been chosen too close to  A.
; C             (it is presumed that DDEABM_DHSTRT has been called with  B
; C             different from  A  on the machine being used. Also see the
; C             discussion about the parameter  SMALL.)
; C
; C      Y(*) -- This is the vector of initial values of the NEQ solution
; C             components at the initial point  A.
; C
; C      YPRIME(*) -- This is the vector of derivatives of the NEQ
; C             solution components at the initial point  A.
; C             (defined by the differential equations in subroutine DF)
; C
; C      ETOL -- This is the vector of error tolerances corresponding to
; C             the NEQ solution components. It is assumed that all
; C             elements are positive. Following the first integration
; C             step, the tolerances are expected to be used by the
; C             integrator in an error test which roughly requires that
; C                        ABS(LOCAL ERROR)  .LE.  ETOL
; C             for each vector component.
; C
; C      MORDER -- This is the order of the formula which will be used by
; C             the initial value method for taking the first integration
; C             step.
; C
; C      SMALL -- This is a small positive machine dependent constant
; C             which is used for protecting against computations with
; C             numbers which are too small relative to the precision of
; C             floating point arithmetic.  SMALL  should be set to
; C             (approximately) the smallest positive DOUBLE PRECISION
; C             number such that  (1.+SMALL) .GT. 1.  on the machine being
; C             used. The quantity  SMALL**(3/8)  is used in computing
; C             increments of variables for approximating derivatives by
; C             differences.  Also the algorithm will not compute a
; C             starting step length which is smaller than
; C             100*SMALL*ABS(A).
; C
; C      BIG -- This is a large positive machine dependent constant which
; C             is used for preventing machine overflows. A reasonable
; C             choice is to set big to (approximately) the square root of
; C             the largest DOUBLE PRECISION number which can be held in
; C             the machine.
; C
; C      SPY(*),PV(*),YP(*),SF(*) -- These are DOUBLE PRECISION work
; C             arrays of length NEQ which provide the routine with needed
; C             storage space.
; C
; C      RPAR,IPAR -- These are parameter arrays, of DOUBLE PRECISION and
; C             INTEGER type, respectively, which can be used for
; C             communication between your program and the DF subroutine.
; C             They are not used or altered by DDEABM_DHSTRT.
; C

; C  On Output  (after the return from DDEABM_DHSTRT),

; C
; C   Abstract
; C
; C   Subroutine  DDEABM_DSTEPS  is normally used indirectly through subroutine
; C   DDEABM .  Because  DDEABM  suffices for most problems and is much
; C   easier to use, using it should be considered before using  DDEABM_DSTEPS
; C   alone.
; C
; C   Subroutine DDEABM_DSTEPS integrates a system of  NEQN  first order ordinary
; C   differential equations one step, normally from X to X+H, using a
; C   modified divided difference form of the Adams Pece formulas.  Local
; C   extrapolation is used to improve absolute stability and accuracy.
; C   The code adjusts its order and step size to control the local error
; C   per unit step in a generalized sense.  Special devices are included
; C   to control roundoff error and to detect when the user is requesting
; C   too much accuracy.
; C
; C   This code is completely explained and documented in the text,
; C   Computer Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations, The Initial
; C   Value Problem  by L. F. Shampine and M. K. Gordon.
; C   Further details on use of this code are available in "Solving
; C   Ordinary Differential Equations with ODE, STEP, and INTRP",
; C   by L. F. Shampine and M. K. Gordon, SLA-73-1060.
; C
; C
; C   The parameters represent --
; C      DF -- subroutine to evaluate derivatives
; C      NEQN -- number of equations to be integrated
; C      Y(*) -- solution vector at X
; C      X -- independent variable
; C      H -- appropriate step size for next step.  Normally determined by
; C           code
; C      EPS -- local error tolerance
; C      WT(*) -- vector of weights for error criterion
; C      START -- logical variable set .TRUE. for first step,  .FALSE.
; C           otherwise
; C      HOLD -- step size used for last successful step
; C      K -- appropriate order for next step (determined by code)
; C      KOLD -- order used for last successful step
; C      CRASH -- logical variable set .TRUE. when no step can be taken,
; C           .FALSE. otherwise.
; C      YP(*) -- derivative of solution vector at  X  after successful
; C           step
; C      KSTEPS -- counter on attempted steps
; C      TWOU -- 2.*U where U is machine unit roundoff quantity
; C      FOURU -- 4.*U where U is machine unit roundoff quantity
; C      RPAR,IPAR -- parameter arrays which you may choose to use
; C            for communication between your program and subroutine F.
; C            They are not altered or used by DDEABM_DSTEPS.
; C   The variables X,XOLD,KOLD,KGI and IVC and the arrays Y,PHI,ALPHA,G,
; C   W,P,IV and GI are required for the interpolation subroutine SINTRP.
; C   The remaining variables and arrays are included in the call list
; C   only to eliminate local retention of variables between calls.
; C
; C   Input to DDEABM_DSTEPS
; C
; C      First call --
; C
; C   The user must provide storage in his calling program for all arrays
; C   in the call list, namely
; C
; C     DIMENSION Y(NEQN),WT(NEQN),PHI(NEQN,16),P(NEQN),YP(NEQN),PSI(12),
; C    1  ALPHA(12),BETA(12),SIG(13),V(12),W(12),G(13),GI(11),IV(10),
; C    2  RPAR(*),IPAR(*)
; C
; C    **Note**
; C
; C   The user must also declare  START ,  CRASH ,  PHASE1  and  NORND
; C   logical variables and  DF  an EXTERNAL subroutine, supply the
; C   subroutine  DF(X,Y,YP)  to evaluate
; C      DY(I)/DX = YP(I) = DF(X,Y(1),Y(2),...,Y(NEQN))
; C   and initialize only the following parameters.
; C      NEQN -- number of equations to be integrated
; C      Y(*) -- vector of initial values of dependent variables
; C      X -- initial value of the independent variable
; C      H -- nominal step size indicating direction of integration
; C           and maximum size of step.  Must be variable
; C      EPS -- local error tolerance per step.  Must be variable
; C      WT(*) -- vector of non-zero weights for error criterion
; C      START -- .TRUE.
; C      YP(*) -- vector of initial derivative values
; C      KSTEPS -- set KSTEPS to zero
; C      TWOU -- 2.*U where U is machine unit roundoff quantity
; C      FOURU -- 4.*U where U is machine unit roundoff quantity
; C   Define U to be the machine unit roundoff quantity by calling
; C   the function routine  D1MACH,  U = D1MACH(4), or by
; C   computing U so that U is the smallest positive number such
; C   that 1.0+U .GT. 1.0.
; C
; C   DDEABM_DSTEPS  requires that the L2 norm of the vector with components
; C   LOCAL ERROR(L)/WT(L)  be less than  EPS  for a successful step.  The
; C   array  WT  allows the user to specify an error test appropriate
; C   for his problem.  For example,
; C      WT(L) = 1.0  specifies absolute error,
; C            = ABS(Y(L))  error relative to the most recent value of the
; C                 L-th component of the solution,
; C            = ABS(YP(L))  error relative to the most recent value of
; C                 the L-th component of the derivative,
; C            = MAX(WT(L),ABS(Y(L)))  error relative to the largest
; C                 magnitude of L-th component obtained so far,
; C            = ABS(Y(L))*RELERR/EPS + ABSERR/EPS  specifies a mixed
; C                 relative-absolute test where  RELERR  is relative
; C                 error,  ABSERR  is absolute error and  EPS =
; C                 MAX(RELERR,ABSERR) .
; C
; C      Subsequent calls --
; C
; C   Subroutine  DDEABM_DSTEPS  is designed so that all information needed to
; C   continue the integration, including the step size  H  and the order
; C   K , is returned with each step.  With the exception of the step
; C   size, the error tolerance, and the weights, none of the parameters
; C   should be altered.  The array  WT  must be updated after each step
; C   to maintain relative error tests like those above.  Normally the
; C   integration is continued just beyond the desired endpoint and the
; C   solution interpolated there with subroutine  SINTRP .  If it is
; C   impossible to integrate beyond the endpoint, the step size may be
; C   reduced to hit the endpoint since the code will not take a step
; C   larger than the  H  input.  Changing the direction of integration,
; C   i.e., the sign of  H , requires the user set  START = .TRUE. before
; C   calling  DDEABM_DSTEPS  again.  This is the only situation in which  START
; C   should be altered.

; C   The subroutine returns after each successful step with  START  and
; C   CRASH  set .FALSE. .  X  represents the independent variable
; C   advanced one step of length  HOLD  from its value on input and  Y
; C   the solution vector at the new value of  X .  All other parameters
; C   represent information corresponding to the new  X  needed to
; C   continue the integration.
; C
; C      Unsuccessful Step --
; C
; C   When the error tolerance is too small for the machine precision,
; C   the subroutine returns without taking a step and  CRASH = .TRUE. .
; C   An appropriate step size and error tolerance for continuing are
; C   estimated and all other information is restored as upon input
; C   before returning.  To continue with the larger tolerance, the user
; C   just calls the code again.  A restart is neither required nor
; C   desirable.
