;
; PURPOSE:
;   Parse a tabular ASCII data file or string array.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;   TRANSREAD, UNIT, VARi [, FORMAT=FORMAT]  (first usage)
;      or
;   TRANSREAD, UNIT, VARi [, FORMAT=FORMAT], FILENAME=FILENAME  (second usage)
;      or
;   TRANSREAD, STRINGARRAY, VARi [, FORMAT=FORMAT]  (second usage)
;
; DESCRIPTION:
;   TRANSREAD parses an ASCII table into IDL variables, one variable
;   for each column in the table.  The tabular data is not limited to
;   numerical values, and can be processed with an IDL FORMAT
;   expression.
;
;   TRANSREAD behaves similarly to READF/READS in that it transfers
;   ASCII input data into IDL variables.  The difference is that
;   TRANSREAD reads more than one row in one pass, and returns data by
;   column.  In a sense, it forms the *transpose* of the typical
;   output from READF or READS (which returns data by row), hence the
;   name TRANSREAD.  [ TRANSREAD can parse up to 20 columns in its
;   current implementation, but that number can be easily increased. ]
;
;   TRANSREAD can optionally be provided with a FORMAT expression to
;   control the transfer of data.  The usage is the same as for
;   READ/READF/READS.  However, you may find that you need to slightly
;   modify your format statements to read properly.  In this
;   implementation, variables are intermediately parsed with READS,
;   which appears from my experimentation to require at least a
;   default length for transfers.
;
;   Hence, you should use:   ..., FORMAT='(D0.0,D0.0,I0)'       ; GOOD
;   instead of:              ..., FORMAT='(D,D,I)'          ; BAD
;
;   As with the standard IDL READ-style commands, you need to supply
;   initial values to your variables before calling TRANSREAD, which
;   are used to determine the type.  Then dimensions of the variable
;   are not important; TRANSREAD will grow the arrays to an
;   appropriate size to accomodate the input.  Lines from the input
;   which do not contain the correct number of columns or do not obey
;   the format statement are ignored.
;
;   TRANSREAD will also flexibly manage typical data files, which may
;   contain blank lines, lines with comments (see COMMENT keyword), or
;   incomplete lines.  These lines are ignored.  It can be programmed
;   to wait for a user-specified "trigger" phrase in the input before
;   beginning or ending processing, which can be useful if for example
;   the input table contains some header lines (see STARTCUE and
;   STOPCUE keywords).  [ The user can also pre-read these lines
;   before calling TRANSREAD. ]  Finally, the total number of lines
;   read can be controlled (see MAXLINES keyword).  TRANSREAD parses
;   until (a) the file ends, (b) the STOPCUE condition is met or (c)
;   the number of lines read reaches MAXLINES.
;
;   TRANSREAD has three possible usages.  In the first, the file must
;   already be open, and TRANSREAD begins reading at the current file
;   position.  In the second usage, a filename is given.  TRANSREAD
;   automatically opens the file, and reads tabular data from the
;   beginning of the file.  Normally the file is then closed, but this
;   can be prevented by using the NOCLOSE keyword.
;
;   In the third usage, a string array is passed instead of a file
;   unit.  Elements from the array are used one-by-one as if they were
;   read from the file.
;
;   Since TRANSREAD is not vectorized, and does a significant amount
;   of processing on a per-line basis, it is probably not optimal to
;   use on very large data files.
;
; INPUTS:
;
;   UNIT - in the first usage, UNIT is an open file unit which
;          contains ASCII tabular data to read.  UNIT must not be a
;          variable which could be mistaken for a string array.
;
;          In the second usage, when FILENAME is specified, then upon
;          return UNIT contains the file unit that TRANSREAD used for
;          reading.  Normally, the UNIT is closed before return, but
;          it can be kept open using the NOCLOSE keyword.  In that
;          case the unit should be closed with FREE_LUN.
;
;   STRINGARRAY - this is the third usage of TRANSREAD.  When a string
;                 array is passed, elements from the array are used as
;                 if they were lines from an input file.  The array
;                 must not be of a numeric type, so it cannot be
;                 mistaken for a file unit.  [ Of course, the string
;                 itself can contain ASCII numeric data. ]
;
; OUTPUTS:
;   VARi - List of named variables to receive columns from the table,
;          one variable for each column.  Upon output each variable
;          will be an array containing the same number of elements,
;          one for each row in the table.  If no rows were
;          successfully parsed, then the variable values are not
;          changed.  Use the COUNT output keyword to determine whether
;          any rows were parsed.
;
;          NOTE: Up to twenty columns may be parsed.  If more columns
;          are desired, then a simple modification must be made to the
;          IDL source code.  To do so, find the beginning of the
;          procdure definition, identified by the words, "pro
;          transread, ..."  and follow the instructions there.
;
; INPUT KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;   FORMAT - an IDL format expression to be used to transfer *each*
;            row in the table.  If no format as given then the default
;            IDL transfer format is used, based on the types of the
;            input variables.  As mentioned in the description above,
;            a length should be assigned to each format code; a length
;            of zero can be used for numeric types.  Lines from the
;            input which do not contain the correct number of columns
;            or do not obey the format statement are ignored.
;
;   COMMENT - A one-character string which designates a "comment" in
;             the input.  Input lines beginning with this character
;             (preceded by optional spaces) are ignored.  FAILCOUNT
;             does not increase.
;             DEFAULT: no comments are recognized.
;
;             NOTE: lines which do not match the format statement are
;             ignored.  Comments are likely to be ignored based on
;             this behavior, even without specifying the COMMENT
;             keyword; however the FAILCOUNT will increase.
;
;   MAXLINES - the maximum number of lines to be read from input.  The
;              count begins *after* any STARTCUE is satisfied (if any)
;              DEFAULT: no maximum is imposed.
;
;   SKIPLINES - the number of lines of input to skip before beginning
;               to parse the table.
;               DEFAULT: no lines are skipped.
;               NOTE: if STARTCUE is also given, then the line count
;               does not start until after the STARTCUE phrase has
;               been encountered.
;
;   STARTCUE - a unique string phrase that triggers the start of
;              parsing.  Lines up to and including the line containing
;              the cue are ignored.  Because each line is checked for
;              this starting cue, it should be unambiguous.
;              DEFAULT: parsing begins immediately.
;
;   STOPCUE - a unique string phrase that triggers the finishing of
;             parsing.  The line including the cue is ignored, and no
;             more reads occur afterward.
;             DEFAULT: no STOPCUE is imposed.
;
;   FILENAME - the presence of this keyword signals the second usage,
;              where TRANSREAD explicitly opens the input file named
;              by the string FILENAME.  Reading begins at the start of
;              the file.
;
;              Normally TRANSREAD will close the input file when it
;              finishes.  This can be prevented by setting the NOCLOSE
;              keyword.
;
;              DEFAULT: input is either an already-opened file passed
;              via the UNIT keyword, or a string array.
;
;   NOCLOSE - if set and if FILENAME is given, then the file is not
;             closed upon return.  The file unit is returned in UNIT,
;             and must be closed by the user via FREE_LUN, UNIT.
;             DEFAULT: any files that TRANSREAD opens are closed.
;
;   DEBUG - set this keyword to enable debugging messages.  Detailed
;           error messages will be printed for each failed line.
;
; OUTPUT KEYWORDS:
;   LINES - the number of lines read, including comments and failed
;           parses.
;
;   COUNT - the number of rows successfully parsed.  Can be zero if
;           accessing the input utterly fails, or if no rows are
;           present.
;
;   FAILCOUNT - the number of rows that could not be parsed
;               successfully.  Comments and blank lines are not
;               included.
;
; EXAMPLES:
;   OPENR, UNIT, 'widgets.dat', /GET_LUN
;   A = '' & B = 0L & C = 0D
;   TRANSREAD, UNIT, A, B, C, COUNT=COUNT, FORMAT='(A10,I0,D0.0)'
;   FREE_LUN, UNIT
;
;   (First usage) Opens widgets.dat and reads three columns.  The
;   first column is a ten-character string, the second an integer, and
;   the third a double precision value.
;
;   A = '' & B = 0L & C = 0D
;   TRANSREAD, UNIT, A, B, C, COUNT=COUNT, FORMAT='(A10,I0,D0.0)', $
;      FILENAME='widgets.dat'
;
;   (Second usage) Achieves the same effect as the first example, but
;   TRANSREAD opens and closes the file automatically.
;
;   SPAWN, 'cat widgets.dat', BUF
;   A = '' & B = 0L & C = 0D
;   TRANSREAD, BUF, A, B, C, COUNT=COUNT, FORMAT='(A10,I0,D0.0)'
;
;   (Third usage) Achieves the same effect as the first two examples,
;   but input is read from the string variable BUF.
;
