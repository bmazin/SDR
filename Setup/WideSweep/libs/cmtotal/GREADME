The following instructions apply to the graphics package of the
Markwardt IDL Library.

These graphics procedures provide additional graphics capabilities not
found in standard IDL, which I am making available for the public.  I
use these routines in every passing, so I have tried to make them as
general and robust as possible.  I am interested in hearing your
feedback.
