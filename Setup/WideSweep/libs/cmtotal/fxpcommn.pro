; FXPIPE_COMMON - information related to pipes in the FXFILTER package.

;  POINTER     - for each LUN, the current file pointer (a long integer)
;  CACHE_UNIT  - for each pipe LUN, the LUN of the cache file.
;  CACHE_LEN   - for each cache LUN, the number of cached bytes.
;  CACHE_MAX   - for each cache LUN, the maximum size of the cache.
;  CACHE_FILE  - for each pipe LUN, the name of the cache file. (a string)
;  EOF_REACHED - for each pipe LUN, a flag indicating whether the end
;                of the pipe has been reached.
;  PROCESS_ID  - for each pipe LUN, the process ID of the pipe
;                command.
;  BYTELENS    - the length in bytes of each IDL data type.
