; PURPOSE:
;   Open IDL SAVE file for reading or writing
;

;   
; DESCRIPTION: 
;
;   CMSV_OPEN opens an IDL SAVE-formatted file for reading or writing.
;   The mode of operation is controlled by the ACCESS keyword, which
;   may be either 'R' for reading, 'W' for writing, or 'RW' for
;   read/write access.
;
;   'R': In the case of reading, the specified file is opened with
;   read-only access, and the first bytes are examined to verify that
;   it is indeed a valid IDL SAVE file.  
;
;   'W': In the case of writing, the specified file is opened with
;   write access, and the initial file signature is written.  
;
;   'RW': In the case of read-write access, the file must already
;   exist as a valid SAVE file.  Users are advised that every time
;   they switch between reading and writing operations, they must use
;   POINT_LUN to flush the file buffers.
;
;   The CMSVLIB routines do not support file sizes greater than 2 GB,
;   nor SAVE files created with the COMPRESS option.
;
;   Upon return, the file pointer is positioned at the start of the
;   first valid SAVE record.  The file offset is returned in OFFSET.
;   The user is responsible for reading or writing the remainder of
;   the file with other library routines.
;
;   The file unit is determined based on the following criteria.  This
;   behavior is similar to the OPEN family of procedures, except for
;   the REOPEN keyword.
;
;     * If REOPEN is set then it is assumed that UNIT is an
;       already-open file, and FILENAME is ignored.  
;
;     * If GET_LUN is set then a file unit is allocated with GET_LUN,
;       and upon success this unit is returned in UNIT.
;
;     * Otherwise it is asssumed that UNIT is a valid but unopened
;       file unit.  Upon successful return, UNIT is opened.
;
;   This procedure is part of the CMSVLIB SAVE library for IDL by
;   Craig Markwardt.  You must have the full CMSVLIB core package
;   installed in order for this procedure to function properly.

; ==================================================================
;
;
; INPUTS:
;
;   UNIT - a logical unit number (a scalar).  In the case of GET_LUN,
;          a file unit will be allocated and returned in UNIT.  In the
;          default case, or REOPEN, UNIT must be a valid file unit
;          upon input.  For REOPEN the corresponding file must be
;          seekable.
;
;   FILENAME - a scalar string specifying the filename path (ignored
;              for REOPEN).
;
;   OFFSET - upon return, the file offset of the next available SAVE
;            record.
;
;
; KEYWORDS:
;
;   ACCESS - a scalar string, case insensitive:
;               'R' - read-only access
;               'W' - write access (new file)
;               'RW' - read-write access (existing file)
;            Default: 'R' - read-only
;
;   GET_LUN - if set, the file unit is allocated using GET_LUN
;
;   FORCE - if set, then the file is opened despite a detected file
;           format inconsistency.
;
;   REOPEN - if set, then an already-opened file is manipulated.  The
;            valid file unit must be specified by UNIT, and FILENAME
;            is ignored.
;
;   COMPATIBILITY - a string, which describes the format to be used in
;          the output file.  Possible values are:
;
;                  'IDL4' - format of IDL version 4;
;                  'IDL5' - format of IDL versions 5.0-5.3;
;                  'IDL6' - not supported yet, for versions 5.4-above;
;                  'RIVAL1' - same as 'IDL5', plus a directory entry is
;                            written to the file.
;           Note that files written in IDL5 format may still be
;           readable by IDL v.4.
;           Default: 'IDL5'
;
;
;   STATUS - upon return, this keyword will contain 1 for success and
;            0 for failure.
;
;   ERRMSG - upon return with a failure, this keyword will contain the
;            error condition as a string.
