Known problems in the iwindow object

If a new image smaller than the current image
is set it sometimes doesn't display correctly.
  Try resizing the window a few times to fix this.

Resizing the window can sometimes lose a scroll bar.
  Resize again, maybe several times.

Sometimes exiting the zoom mode will cause any mouse
motion to pan the image.  Left click to clear this.
