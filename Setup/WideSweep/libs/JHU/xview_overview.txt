  XVIEW is a simple image viewing widget with
  a few processing tools available.  Screen windows
  may also be saved as images in a number of formats.

  XVIEW is not meant to be a complete image procesing tool,
  it is useful for loading an image to a screen window where
  IDL can then do more processing.  The result may be saved
  to an image file using XVIEW.

  A few basic image tools are provided and the user may add
  custom processing (see help for the buttons).
