This directory contain IDL procedures for manipulating FITS images which include
header keywords specifying the coordinate system.   The FITS header must follow
the world coordinate (WCS) specification in the paper "Representations of
Celestial Coordinates in FITS"  by Eric Greisen and Mark Calabretta (2002, A&A,
395, 1061).   This paper and other WCS documentation may be obtained from    
http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_wcs.html.  All projections in that paper are 
implemented as of May 2004      The IDL code has been  validated using the test
images on http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/mcalabre/WCS/sample_data/index.html 

Bill Thompson has written a different IDL implementation of the WCS
specification which also includes support fo solar and spectroscopic
coordinates.    His routines are available at the SolarSoftWare (SSW) library
at     http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/solarsoft/gen/idl/wcs/

The FITS convention defines the center of the first pixel in the
array to have coordinates (1,1).    This differs from the IDL convention where
the first pixel has coordinates (0,0).    Whenever an (X,Y) position is
extracted or inserted into a FITS header then this difference must be accounted
for.

Several procedures use an IDL structure that contains astrometry information in
the following tags:

  .NAXIS - 2 element long vector giving dimensions of the images
  .CD	-  2 x 2 array containing the astrometry parameters CD1_1 CD1_2
	   in DEGREES/PIXEL				      CD2_1 CD2_2
  .CDELT - 2 element vector giving physical increment at the reference pixel
  .CRPIX - 2 element vector giving X and Y coordinates of reference pixel
	   (def = NAXIS/2) in FITS convention (first pixel is 1,1)
  .CRVAL - 2 element double precision vector giving R.A. and DEC of 
	 reference pixel in DEGREES
  .CTYPE - 2 element string vector giving projection types, default
	 ['RA---TAN','DEC--TAN']
  .LONGPOLE - scalar longitude of north pole (default = 180)
  .LATPOLE - scalar giving native latitude of the celestial pole default=0)
  .PV2 - Vector of parameters (PV2_1, PV2_2...) needed in some projections 
  .DISTORT - Optional substructure giving distortion parameters.   Currently
         only implemented for the Spitzer simple imaging polynomial (SIP) see
         http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/postbcd/doc/shupeADASS.pdf

The procedures EXTAST and PUTAST can be used, respectively, to extract
astrometry information from a FITS header and place it into an astrometry
structure, and to put the information from an astrometry structure into a FITS
header.  

      IDL> extast, hdr, astr     ;Extract astrometry from a FITS header
      IDL> putast, hdr, astr     ;Put astrometry info into a FITS header 

(1) Following the discussion in Section 5 of the Greisen & Calabretta paper,
this software supports three WCS formats: (1) the PC matrix with the separate
CDELT parameters (preferred), (2) the CD matrix without CDELT parameters (IRAF
standard),  and (3) the old-style AIPS (CDELT + CROTA) notation. The CDELT tag
is not used in format (2), and is normally set to [1.0, 1.0].    However, for
an AIPS-style header, the CDELT values are stored in the CDELT tag, and the
CROTA value is stored in the CD matrix     

cd = [ [ cos(crota), -sin(crota) ] , [ sin(crota), cos(crota)] ] 

If either element of the CDELT tag differs from 1.0 then this signals that the
astrometry came from an AIPS type header.    Programs using the astrometry
structure should always use the following code 

 if N_elements(CDELT) GE 2 then if (cdelt[0] NE 1.0) then begin
        cd[0,0] = cd[0,0]*cdelt[0] & cd[0,1] =  cd[0,1]*cdelt[0]
        cd[1,1] = cd[1,1]*cdelt[1] & cd[1,0] =  cd[1,0]*cdelt[1]
 endif


(2) Earlier draft versions of the World Coordinate System paper represented the
CD matrix in a FITS header with names such as 'CD001001' rather than 'CD1_1', and
'PC001001' instead of 'PC1_1'.   This notation is no longer recognized, but the
procedure FITS_CD_FIX can be used to convert the FITS header to modern notation.

(3) The CRPIX value is stored in the astrometry structure the same way as it is
in the FITS header, i.e. in FORTRAN (first pixel is 1) convention.    

(4) The procedures HREBIN and HCONGRID will update the astrometry, including the
SIP distortion coefficients,  when expanding or contracting an image.   However,
note that HROT or HROTATE currently will not update any SIP coefficients if
present. 

Special astrometry procedures are required for the Digitized Sky Survey Images
which were released on CD-Rom in early 1994.    Information about the Guidestar
images can be obtained from http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/
and the Guidestar images can also be obtained from the SKYVIEW facility
at http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/skyview.html.  The Schmidt plates used in
this survey have a highly nonlinear plate solution that is not covered
by the Greisen & Calabretta conventions.     The procedures GSSSEXTAST, 
GSSSXYAD and GSSSADXY are the Guidestar survey analogues of the procedures
EXTAST, XY2AD, and ADXY for standard astrometry.     All the astrometry
procedures in the library will test for a Guidestar image header (by looking
for the 'PPO1' keyword) and call the appropriate procedures.    The procedure
GSSS_STDAST will convert the astrometry in a guidestar image header to 
an standard tangent projection with very slightly degraded accuracy.
