The procedures in this directory are taken from the IDL program library at the
Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Applied Physics Lab (APL) at 
http://fermi.jhuapl.edu/s1r/idl/idl.html.    They are duplicated here either 
because they are used by other procedures in the Astronomy library, or because
they are strongly related to Astronomy.    Users who have both the Astronomy 
Library and the JHU library can delete this directory.     Please inform 
wayne.landsman@nasa.gov if there are any discrepancies between these
procedures and those in the JHUAPL library.  

An updated version of  YDN2MD procedure from the JHUAPL library is available in
the /astro directory.
