; NAME:
;       PROB_KUIPER
; PURPOSE:
;       Return the significance of the Kuiper statistic
; EXPLANATION:
;       Returns the significance level of an observed value of the
;       Kuiper statistic D for an effective number of data points
;       N_eff.   Called by KUIPERONE
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;       prob_kuiper, D, N_eff, probks
;
; INPUT PARAMATERS:
;       D -  Kuiper statistic, floating scalar, always non-negative
;       N_eff - Effective number of data points, scalar.   For a 2 sided test
;               this is given by (N1*N2)/(N1+N2) where N1 and N2 are the number
;               of points in each data set.
;
; OUTPUT PARAMETERS:
;       probks - floating scalar between 0 and 1 giving the significance level of
;               the Kuiper statistic.   Small values of PROB suggest that the
;               distribution being tested are not the same
;
; REVISION HISTORY:
;       Written     W. Landsman                August, 1992
;       Corrected typo (termbv for termbf)    H. Ebeling/W.Landsman  March 1996
;       Probably did not affect numeric result, but iteration went longer
;       than necessary
;       Converted to IDL V5.0   W. Landsman   September 1997
;       Adapted from PROB_KS    J. Ballet     July 2003
