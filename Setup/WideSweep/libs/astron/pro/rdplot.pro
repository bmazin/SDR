; NAME:
;   RDPLOT
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Like CURSOR but with a full-screen cursor and continuous readout option
;
; EXPLANATION:
;   This program is designed to essentially mimic the IDL CURSOR command,
;   but with the additional options of continuously printing out the data
;   values of the cursor's position, and using a full-screen cursor rather 
;   than a small cross cursor.  The full screen cursor uses OPLOT and 
;   X-windows graphics masking to emulate the cursor.
;      One difference is that IF the PRINT keyword is set but the DOWN,
;   WAIT, CHANGE, or NOWAIT keywords are not set, then the leftmost mouse
;   button will print a "newline" line-feed, but not exit.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;   RDPLOT [, X, Y] [, WaitFlag] [, /DATA | /DEVICE | /NORMAL]
;      [, /NOWAIT | /WAIT | /DOWN | /CHANGE] 
;      [, /FULLCURSOR] [, /NOCLIP] [, /CROSS] [, /ACCUMULATE]
;      [, ERR=, PRINT=, XTITLE=, YTITLE=, XVALUES=, YVALUES=
;       , LINESTYLE=, THICK=, COLOR=, BACKGROUND=]
;
; REQUIRED INPUTS:
;   None.
;
; OPTIONAL INPUTS: 
;   WAITFLAG = Uses the same table as the intrinsic CURSOR command, But note
;	that unlike the CURSOR command, there is no UP keyword.
;		WaitFlag=0 sets the NOWAIT keyword
;		WaitFlag=1 sets the WAIT keyword {default}
;		WaitFlag=2 sets the CHANGE keyword
;		WaitFlag=3 sets the DOWN keyword
;
; OPTIONAL OUTPUTS:
;    X - a named variable to receive the final cursor X position, scalar
;        or vector (if /ACCUMULATE is set)
;    Y - a named variable to receive the final cursor Y position, scalar
;        or vector (if /ACCUMULATE is set)
; OPTIONAL KEYWORD INPUT PARAMETERS:
;   /DATA - data coordinates are displayed and returned.
;   /DEVICE - device coordinates are displayed and returned.
;   /NORMAL - normal coordinates are displayed and returned.
;      Default is to use DATA coordinates if available (see notes).
;   /NOWAIT = if non-zero the routine will immediately return the cursor's
;      present position.
;   /WAIT - if non-zero will wait for a mouse key click before returning.  If
;      cursor key is already down, then procedure immediately exits.
;   /DOWN - equivalent to WAIT *except* that if the mouse key is already down
;      when the procedure is called, the procedure will wait until the mouse
;      key is clicked down again.
;   /CHANGE - returns when the mouse is moved OR a key is clicked up or down.
;   PRINT = if non-zero will continuously print out (at the terminal) the data 
;      values of the cursor's position.  If PRINT>1, program will printout a 
;      brief header describing the mouse button functions.  However, note that 
;      the button functions are overridden if any of the DOWN, WAIT, or
;      CHANGE values are non-zero.
;   XTITLE = label used to describe the values of the abscissa if PRINT>0.
;   YTITLE = label used to describe the values of the ordinate if PRINT>0.
;   XVALUES = a vector corresponding to the values to be printed when the
;	PRINT keyword is set.  This allows the user the option of printing
;	out other values rather than the default X coordinate position of
;	the cursor.  E.g., if XVALUES is a string vector of dates such as
;	['May 1', 'May 2', ...], then those dates will be printed rather than
;	the X value of the cursor's position: if X=1 then 'May 2' would be
;	printed, etc.  This requires that the values of the X coordinate read
;	by the cursor must be positive (can't access negative elements).
;       If XVALUES=-1, then NO values for X will be printed.
;   YVALUES = analogous to the XVALUES keyword.
;   /FULLCURSOR - if non-zero default cursor is blanked out and full-screen 
;      (or full plot window, depending on the value of NOCLIP) lines are
;      drawn; their intersecton is centered on the cursor position.
;   /NOCLIP - if non-zero will make a full-screen cursor, otherwise it will
;      default to the value in !P.NOCLIP.
;   LINESTYLE = style of line that makes the full-screen cursor.
;   THICK = thickness of the line that makes the full-screen cursor.
;   COLOR = color of the full-screen cursor.
;   BACKGROUND = color of the background of the plot device.  If this has
;      been set to !P.BackGround, then this keyword is unnecessary.
;   CROSS = if non-zero will show the regular cross AND full screen cursors.
;   /ACCUMULATE - all of the positions for which the left button was
;      clicked are stored in the X and Y variables.  Has no effect if X and Y 
;      are not present.
;
; OPTIONAL KEYWORD OUTPUT PARAMETER:
;   ERR = returns the most recent value of the !mouse.button value.
;
; NOTES:
;   Note that this procedure does not allow the "UP" keyword/flag...which 
;   doesn't seem to work too well in the origianl CURSOR version anyway.
;
;   If a data coordinate system has not been established, then RDPLOT will
;   create one identical to the device coordinate system.   Note that this
;   kluge is required even if the user specified /NORMAL coordinates, since
;   RDPLOT makes use of the OPLOT procedure.  This new data coordinate system
;   is effectively "erased" (!X.CRange and !Y.CRange are both set to zero)
;   upon exit of the routine so as to not change the plot status from the
;   user's point of view.
;
;   Only tested on X-windows systems.  If this program is interrupted, the
;   graphics function might be left in a non-standard state; in that case,
;   run the program RESET_RDPLOT to return the standard graphics functions,
;   or type the command:   DEVICE, /CURSOR_CROSS, SET_GRAPHICS=3, BYPASS=0
;
;   Robishaw added /ACCUMULATE keyword to pass back all the positions at
;   which the mouse was left-clicked.  In addition, the value of the exit
;   click is returned unless the cursor did not change position between the
;   last left-click and the exit click.
;
; BUGS:
;   NOTE: (1/27/05) The bugs below have been fixed by Robishaw and tested
;   on Solaris, Linux and OS-X.
;
;   It is assumed that the current background of the plot is correctly
;   defined by the value in !P.Background.  Otherwise, the color of the
;   long cursor probably will not be correct.  Sometimes the color doesn't
;   work anyway, and I'm not sure why.
;   NOTE: Robishaw fixed this 1/27/05.
;
;   There may be some cases (e.g., when THICK>1 and NOCLIP=0) when the
;   full-screen cursor is not correctly erased, leaving "ghost images" on the
;   plot.  It just seems that the screen updates get slow or the positions
;   ambiguous with a thick line and the cursor off the plot.
;   NOTE: Robishaw fixed this 1/27/05.
;
; PROCEDURE:
;   Basically is a bells-n-whistles version of the CURSOR procedure.  All
;   the details are covered in the above discussion of the keywords.
;
; EXAMPLES:
;   A silly, but informative one:
;   Months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', $
;             'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
;   plot, indgen(12), xrange=[-5, 15]
;   rdplot, /FULL, /PRINT, XTITLE='Month: ', YTITLE='Y-value per month = ', $
;      xvalues=Months
;
;   If your plot has a non-black background color, be sure to set either
;   !p.background or the BACKGROUND keyword.  Here are examples of how to
;   use a blue full-screen cursor on a plot with a red background and
;   yellow axes and data. First, deal with color decomposition off:
;   device, decomposed=0
;   tvlct, [255,255,0], [0,255,0], [0,0,255], 1
;   plot, randomn(seed,1024), XSTYLE=19, PSYM=3, COLOR=2, BACK=1
;   rdplot, /PRINT, /FULL, THICK=5, /NOCLIP, BACK=1, COLOR=3
;
;   For decomposition on (TrueColor or DirectColor only):
;   device, decomposed=1
;   plot, randomn(seed,1024), XSTYLE=19, PSYM=3, COLOR=65535l, BACK=255l
;   rdplot, /PRINT, /FULL, THICK=5, /NOCLIP, BACK=255l, COLOR=16711680l
;
; MODIFICATION HISTORY:
;   Written (originally named CURFULL) by J.Wm.Parker  1993 Nov 22 
;   Created data coordinates if not already present, W. Landsman Nov. 93
;   Added continuous printout of data values, COLOR and FULLCURSOR keywords
;      (so that default is that it acts just like the cursor command).
;      Changed name from CURFULL to RDPLOT.   J.Wm.Parker  1994 Apr 20
;   Modified (with some translation table assistance from the IDL support 
;      group) to correctly plot the crosshair with the desired IDL 
;      color using the device's translation table to determine the XOR 
;      function and using the BYPASS function.  Added the RESET_RDPLOT
;      procedure to cleanup crashes that might occur while running
;      RDPLOT.  Other minor changes/bug fixes.  J.Wm.Parker  1994 May 21
;   Modified DOWN, WAIT, CHANGE functions to behave more similar to the
;      generic CURSOR procedure.   J.Wm.Parker  1995 April 24
;   Added XVALUES, YVALUES keywords and cleanup.   J.Wm.Parker  1995 April 24
;   Convert to IDL V5.0,  W. Landsman    July 1998
;   Change !D.NCOLORS to !D.TABLE_SIZE for 24 bit displays W. Landsman May 2000
;   Skip translation table for TrueColor visuals   W. Landsman  March 2001
;   Fixed /FULLCURSOR ghosts. Fixed to properly deal with background colors
;      in 24-bit visual classes (TrueColor and DirectColor).  Added
;      BACKGROUND keyword. Tim Robishaw 2005 Jan 27       
;   Added /ACCUMULATE keyword. T. Robishaw 2006 Nov 8
;   Corrected following problems. When /CHANGE and /PRINT were set,
;      returned X & Y were different than those printed.  When /PRINT and
;      /NOWAIT were set, or /PRINT and /WAIT were set and the routine was
;      entered with a mouse button clicked, nothing was printed. When
;      /PRINT and /DOWN were set, if routine was started with button down,
;      advertised behavior was that routine would exit on next down click;
;      in practice if cursor was not moved, successive down clicks had no
;      effect.  Now, if X is passed as an output variable, requires that Y
;      is also passed, like CURSOR.  Bottom line is that RDPLOT now really
;      does behave like CURSOR and when /PRINT is set, the values printed
;      correspond to those returned in X & Y.  T. Robishaw 2006 Nov 12
;   Fixed misbehavior when color decomposition was set to off for
;      TrueColor and DirectColor.  Now thoroughly tested on PseudoColor
;      displays as well as both decomposition states for TrueColor and
;      DirectColor.  Also made the default cursor color white when
;      decomposition is on (this has been its default value for
;      decomposition off). T. Robishaw 2006 Nov 16

;   I think the best way to make the fullscreen cursor work is to use the XOR
; graphics function - overplotting a line will XOR with the data already on
; the screen, then overplotting the same line again will XOR again, effectively
; erasing the line and returning the device to its original state/appearance.
;    But first, let me present a quick primer on plotting colors in IDL and the 
; related color tables and translation table:
;   Normally, when a color N (a number between 0 and 255 which refers to a
; particular color in the currently loaded IDL color table) is used in one of
; the plotting or tv commands, the value that is actually sent to the display is
; the value in the N-th bin of the translation table.  E.g., if the background
; color is 0, then the actual (device) color value of the background is the
; value in the zeroth bin of the translation table.  Similarly, if the user
; wants to plot the color defined by number 147 in the IDL color table, the
; actual (device) color value of that color is the value in the 147th bin
; of the translation table.
;  So in the following example, let's pretend we have the following situation:
;   IDL> PRINT, !D.N_Colors
;            222
;   IDL> PRINT, !P.Background
;              0
;   IDL> DEVICE, TRANSLATION=TTab
;   IDL> PRINT, TTab[0]
;             34
;   IDL> PRINT, TTab[147]
;            181
;   When we set DEVICE,SET_GRAPHICS=6, and do an overplot, it performs an XOR
; function between the overplot's translated color value and the background's
; translated color value.
;   If we want the resulting color to be the IDL color 147, then we have to 
; overplot with the color whose translated color value XOR'ed with the 
; background's translated color value (34) will equal 181, which is the 
; translated color value of the desired IDL color 147.
;
; Symbolically:
; *  TTab[Desired Color] = TTab[OPLOT color] XOR TTab[Background]
; *  OPLOT Color = where( TTab eq (TTab[Desired Color] XOR TTab[Background]) )
;
; Numerically {using the above example}:
; *  OPLOT Color = where( TTab eq (TTab[147] XOR TTab[0]) )
; *  OPLOT Color = where( TTab eq (181 XOR 34) )
; *  OPLOT Color = where( TTab eq 151 )
;
;   Fine.
;   HOWEVER...since the translation table often does NOT contain the full range
; of possible numbers (e.g., 0 to 255), the result of the XOR function between 
; the background and the oplot color may be a value that does NOT appear in the 
; translation table.  This is particularly a problem for colors near the bottom
; of the translation table where the result of the XOR function may be less than
; the lowest value in TTab.
;   To fix this problem, I bypass the translation table, and directly send the
; device color (e.g., the value 151 in the above example) to the OPLOT command.
;   There is still some bug here - sometimes the color still isn't right.  I'll
; have to talk to the IDL support people about this {as soon as our support
; license is renewed!}
; NOTE: Took a while to figure out how to make the full cursor work with
;       both a specified cursor color and a non-black background.  We stick
;       with the XOR graphics function.  However, we need to deal with the
;       complex case of an indexed color model (Decompositon off) for the
;       TrueColor and DirectColor visual classes.  For TrueColor, we get
;       the RGB triplet stored in the color table at the indices specified
;       by Color and BackGround and convert them to 24-bit decomposed color
;       indices.  Then we turn on color decomposition.  Before we exit, we
;       turn it back off.  For DirectColor, we just need to XOR the 8-bit
;       color table indices.
