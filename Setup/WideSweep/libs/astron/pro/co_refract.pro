; NAME:
;   CO_REFRACT()      
;
; PURPOSE:
;   Calculate correction to altitude due to atmospheric refraction.
;
; DESCRIPTION:
;   CO_REFRACT can calculate both apparent altitude from observed altitude and 
;   vice-versa.
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;   new_alt  = CO_REFRACT(old_alt, [ ALTITUDE= , PRESSURE= , $
;                                  TEMPERATURE= , /TO_OBSERVED , EPSILON= ])
;
; INPUT:
;   old_alt - Observed (apparent) altitude, in DEGREES.  (apparent if keyword 
;             /TO_OBSERVED set).    May be scalar or vector.
;
; OUTPUT: 
;     Function returns apparent (observed) altitude, in DEGREES. (observed if 
;         keyword /TO_OBSERVED set).    Will be of same type as input 
;         altitude(s).
;
; OPTIONAL KEYWORD INPUTS:
;      ALTITUDE :  The height of the observing location, in meters.  This is 
;             only used to determine an approximate temperature and pressure, 
;             if these are not specified separately. [default=0, i.e. sea level]
;      PRESSURE :  The pressure at the observing location, in millibars.
;      TEMPERATURE:    The temperature at the observing location, in Kelvin.
;      EPSILON:  When keyword /TO_OBSERVED has been set, this is the accuracy 
;               to  obtain via the iteration, in arcseconds [default = 0.25 
;                arcseconds].
;      /TO_OBSERVED:  Set this keyword to go from Apparent->Observed altitude, 
;                 using the iterative technique.
;
;       Note, if altitude is set, but temperature or pressure are not, the 
;       program will make an intelligent guess for the temperature and pressure.
;
; DESCRIPTION:
;
;   Because the index of refraction of air is not precisely 1.0, the atmosphere
;   bends all incoming light, making a star or other celestial object appear at
;   a slightly different altitude (or elevation) than it really is.  It is 
;   important to understand the following definitions:
;
;   Observed Altitude:  The altitude that a star is SEEN to BE, with a telescope.
;                       This is where it appears in the sky.  This is always 
;                       GREATER than the apparent altitude.
;
;   Apparent Altitude:  The altitude that a star would be at, if *there were no
;                     atmosphere* (sometimes called "true" altitude). This is 
;                     usually calculated from an object's celestial coordinates.
;                     Apparent altitude is always LOWER than the observed 
;                     altitude.
;
;   Thus, for example, the Sun's apparent altitude when you see it right on the
;   horizon is actually -34 arcminutes.
;
;   This program uses couple simple formulae to estimate the effect for most 
;   optical and radio wavelengths.  Typically, you know your observed altitude 
;   (from an observation), and want the apparent altitude.  To go the other way,
;   this program uses an iterative approach.
;
; EXAMPLE:
;    The lower limb of the Sun is observed to have altitude of 0d 30'.   
;    Calculate the the true (=apparent) altitude of the Sun's lower limb using 
;    mean  conditions of air pressure and temperature
;
;    IDL> print, co_refract(0.5)     ===>  0.025degrees (1.55')
; WAVELENGTH DEPENDENCE:
;    This correction is 0 at zenith, about 1 arcminute at 45 degrees, and 34 
;    arcminutes at the horizon FOR OPTICAL WAVELENGTHS.  The correction is 
;    NON-NEGLIGIBLE at all wavelengths, but is not very easily calculable.  
;    These formulae assume a wavelength of 550 nm, and will be accurate to 
;    about 4 arcseconds for all visible wavelengths, for elevations of 10 
;    degrees and higher.    Amazingly, they are also ACCURATE FOR RADIO 
;    FREQUENCIES LESS THAN ~ 100 GHz.
;
;    It is important to understand that these formulae really can't do better 
;    than about 30 arcseconds of accuracy very close to the horizon, as 
;    variable atmospheric effects become very important.
