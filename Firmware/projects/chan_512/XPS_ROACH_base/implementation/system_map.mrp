        Number using O5 output only:             8
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:       106
  Number of route-thrus:                       825
    Number using O6 output only:               798
    Number using O5 output only:                27

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       52,862
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         6,117 out of  52,862   11%
    Number with an unused LUT:              20,410 out of  52,862   38%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:      26,335 out of  52,862   49%
    Number of unique control sets:             390
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:             741 out of  58,880    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
