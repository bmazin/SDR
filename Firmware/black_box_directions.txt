Blackbox Instructions

make an mdl with the block and gateway in and gateway out blocks
save as name_core.slx
open system generator, set target directory to ./name_core/sysgen, turn off Include Clock Wrapper,
click Generate
call resynth_netlist('name_core/sysgen','name_core.ngc') #resynth with -lc off
in Matlab cd to name_core/sysgen, do
 extract_entity('name_core.ngc')
this creates a name_core.vhd.  This is used in the name_core_config.m

drop blackbox block in design, wizard pops up.
Choose vhd file above
Inputs and outputs appear
adjust core_config.m to reorder input/outputs or change input/output types

put a yellow pcore block at the top of the design. Enter the sysgen/name_core.ngc file

Compile


Planahead Instructions

Compile. cd to XPS_BASE_ROACH2. Run casper_create_ppr.sh
cd planahead
call planAhead file.ppr
Use search to find components to put into pblock

rename/copy impl_1

create a ucf file, put in ucf folder, and rerun Casper workflow

Or, to compile in planAhead:
Go to Flow->Implementation Settings
Under bistream settings, in More options enter -g Binary:Yes
Flow->Run implementation
Flow->Generate Bitstream
This makes file.runs/impl_1/system.bin
Turn system.bin into an fpg following XPS_BASE_ROACH2/gen_prog_files
