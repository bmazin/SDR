Description of compiliable mdl files (Some need a few tries to compile without timing errors).

The following have the deadtime lockout bug and 3pt threshold bug:
chan_dtrig_v2.mdl - First compiled baseline subtraction with alpha=0.1 (running average of 10 pts, lagging 5 pts)
var_lpf_v3.mdl - Compiled baseline subtraction with variable alpha. Still untested. Alpha should work for ~0.1-0.05. IQ fir have effectively 20 taps, custom fir has 26 taps.
iqlpf16_v1.mdl - 550 MHz sample rate with variable alpha baseline subtraction. IQ fir have effectively 16 taps (with correct hardcoded coefficients), and the Custom FIr has 18 taps

The following have the deadtime lockout and 3pt thresholds bugs fixed
chan_512_cfix.mdl - This has the new 512 MHz data packet but does not have baseline triggers.
btrig_fix_v1.mdl - this has baseline triggers where y[t] = alpha*x[-30]+(1-alpha)y[t-10]
chan_snap_v3.mdl - This has the snapQDR block to take a second of raw data
chan_snap_v4.mdl - Has same functionality (except for count rate limit in capture block), but made with updated casper library blocks, and with less fpga resources required.
